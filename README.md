# IPL-FIRST-INNINGS-SCORE-PREDICTION
This project attempts to predict the projected score of first innings as well as to analyse and provide some useful insights about the dataset. A cricket match depends upon various factors, and in this work, the factors which significantly influence the outcome of a Twenty 20 cricket match are identified. The performance of model depends on features like batting team, bowling team, venue, wickets taken in last 5 overs , runs scored in last 5 overs, overs, total score and wickets at current ball. The proposed model contains data from IPL matches played between years 2008 to 2017. A regression based solution is proposed to calculate the first innings score. Six machine learning models were trained and used for predicting the outcome of 2018 and 2019 IPL matches. Three of the trained models were seen to be more accurately predicting the score.
